**OverView of Project**

**Iris Dataset Analysis**
This project involves a detailed analysis and visualization of the Iris dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, often used for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

**Project Structure**
The project is organized as follows:

**Data Loading and Inspection:**

The Iris dataset is loaded using Seaborn's load_dataset function.
The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to get an overview.
Basic information about the dataset, including data types and missing values, is retrieved using info() and describe() methods.
Data Visualization:

**Histograms**: Display the distribution of each feature in the dataset.
**Pairplot**: Visualize pairwise relationships and distributions across different species.
**Scatter Plot**: Scatter plot of Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width, colored by species.
**Correlation Matrix**: A heatmap showing the correlation between different numerical features.
**Violin Plots**: Display the distribution of Sepal Length and Petal Length across different species.
**KDE Plots**: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots to visualize the distribution of Sepal Length for the entire dataset and across different species.
**Pairwise Scatter Plots with Regression Lines**: Pairwise scatter plots including regression lines for better visualization of relationships.
**FacetGrid with Histogram**: FacetGrid to plot histograms of Petal Length, separated by species.
**Bar Plot**: Bar plot showing the average Petal Length for each species with standard deviation error bars.
